# Arrow Movement Scenarios

This project explores various scenarios depicting the movement of arrows in a Unity environment. Each scenario presents a unique path or behavior for the arrow, showcasing different techniques and controls.

## Scenarios

### 1. Straight Path

In this scenario, an arrow moves along a straight path without deviation. The movement is linear and consistent, representing a basic form of arrow trajectory.

### 2. Saw-like Path

The arrow follows a saw-like or zigzag path, alternating between upward and downward movements. The path resembles the teeth of a saw, creating an oscillating motion.

### 3. User-Controlled Dot

In this scenario, the arrow's movement is determined by a dot controlled by the user. The arrow follows the position of the dot as the user moves it within the game environment, providing interactive control over the arrow's direction.

### 4. Sine Path

The arrow's movement follows a sine wave pattern, resulting in smooth oscillations. The amplitude and frequency of the sine wave determine the extent and speed of the arrow's movement.

### 5. Intersecting Arrows

Multiple arrows intersect a randomly generated line after a set interval of time. Each arrow follows its trajectory and intersects the line at different points, demonstrating dynamic interaction between moving objects.

### 6. Ricocheting Behavior

An arrow exhibits ricocheting behavior within a given shape. Upon collision with the shape's boundaries, the arrow reflects off at an angle, simulating ricochet or bounce effects.

## Usage

Each scenario is implemented as a separate Unity scene within the project. To explore these scenarios:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Unity project in the Unity Editor.
3. Navigate to the desired scenario by clicking on the corresponding scene file in the project explorer.
4. Play the scene by clicking on the play button in the Unity Editor toolbar.
5. Explore and interact with the arrow movement scenarios as described above.
